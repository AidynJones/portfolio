# TimeLine

## 26/03/18(Week 1)

Got put in the Semester Tracker project, spent the week Storming and norming, getting to know the other members of the project.  This week we figured out who was going to focus on what part of the project and started brainstorming approaches and frameworks we could use to make the project.

## 02/04/18(Week 2)

We decided we were going to write the Semester tracker in PHP because our client Elise had already made an attempt at making it.  We used this week to have a look at the yii framework and build a basic project in it to see most of the fundamentals of it.

## 09/04/18(Week 3)

Made final decision to go with yii framework, built a basic template yii project and deployed it locally through MAMP/WAMP.  Used this week to look at more advanced yii tutorials and got to know way around basic template file layout, config and database.

## 23/04/18(Holiday)

Not much was done over this week and last as it has been the holidays, I was sick for a lot of it so couldn't put much work into the project.

## 30/04/18(Week 4)

The database has now been created so everyone started to work on pieces of the project, my job was to get the data from the database and display it on the website.  Also to generate the current day and week of the semester on the homepage.

## 07/05/18(Week 5)

I spent this week moving all the logic in the code out of the view and into the controller, I also got a drop down working to allow for different semesters to be shown.

## 14/05/18(Week 6)

Over the course of this week I got assignments showing up next to the weeks they were assigned and holidays showing up next to the week they happen in.  The ability to add data to the database like semesters and assignments was add to the functionality of the site.

## 21/05/18(Week 7)



## 28/05/18(Week 8)

This week we got the login system working by checking the database for a created user, also fixed a lot of bugs like multiple assignments on same week messing up table and unneeded tabs in navbar.  A lot of this week was spent working on this portfolio.


## 04/06/18(Week 9)

This week I worked on getting a working api for use by the learning analytics project or use if this software is used in Project to allow the software to be integrated with other softwares.  My api currently only provides all data from the database in json, I coded a create method for the api too but haven't included it yet as I am unsure if it will be needed.
