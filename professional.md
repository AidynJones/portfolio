# Professional Proficiency

## Communication
### Thoughts
As a group we decided to go with discord for our main source of communication, this included 3 text channels, 1 for general communication, 1 for important links and 1 for files and images, and we had a voice channel for conference calls.  For recording user stories, tracking bugs and keeping track of who was doing what we used Jordans own bugtracking site made on aperion-industries server.  Even though this was quite complicated at first and was only really used by Jordan in the first couple of weeks everyone finally came to grips with the layout and functionality it became a really useful and helpful tool.

We would meet up and have scrums at least twice a week in class and some weeks we had a third scrum outside of class.  This would include everyone showing what they had accomplished since the last scrum and people could ask for help if they got stuck on their current task.  On the few occasions that someone was stuck for a couple of scrums in a row another person would team up and they would work together to get the problem solved.  An example of this was when James was quite confused with how Yii worked and how to get the site up and running on a computer (this required setup of a server like MAMP or WAMP and setup of the database from sql files). So we met up at lunch and I spent an hour showing him the basics of the file layout and how to get it up and running, this allowed him to confidently complete the tasks assigned to him.

At the start of our project we were quite confused as to who our client was because when we asked Elise she said it was Adon, so we organised and had a meeting with him and the only user story he gave us was to create an api(I didn't know what that was at that time) for the software we had not yet began building.  So we went back to Elise and confirmed that she would be the main client and provide us with the user stories to start the project.
### Reflection
Looking back over the semester I believe that the choice to go with discord was not the best choice, I found that when someone sent a message I wouldn't always recieve a notification on my phone and I am hardly logged in on my PC.  When I sent a message I found that there usually wasn't a quick response and I had to wait before contact was intiated.  We also never used the voice channel which we orginally planed to host conference calls on, in my opinion I believe that we should have used either slack or made use of the group chat function in facebook messenger.

I think that our efforts on scrums wasn't as good as it should have been because as a group no one really pushed for these to happen and they usually only took place in class.  This meant that if someone got stuck they had to wait a few days before they could get any help to overcome the problem they were stuck on.


### Evidence of Learning

## Leadership
### Thoughts
When we got put into a group we established roles based on personality and skills, Jordan took charge and became the leader focusing on the backend and database side of the software, I was then assigned to look into learning the Yii framework and see if it would work to build our software around.  I built a basic template site powered by the Yii framework and we decided to go with that for our software, over the first few weeks I took charge over how the site was built and in what direction we would take it to produce the product the the client was after, this was because I was the only one who had learned the layout of the site files and how Yii was written and worked.
