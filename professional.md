# Professional Proficiency

## Communication
### Thoughts
As a group we decided to go with discord for our main source of communication, this included 3 text channels, 1 for general communication, 1 for important links and 1 for files and images, and we had a voice channel for conference calls.  For recording user stories, tracking bugs and keeping track of who was doing what we used Jordans own bugtracking site made on aperion-industries server.  Even though this was quite complicated at first and was only really used by Jordan in the first couple of weeks everyone finally came to grips with the layout and functionality it became a really useful and helpful tool.

We would meet up and have scrums at least twice a week in class and some weeks we had a third scrum outside of class.  This would include everyone showing what they had accomplished since the last scrum and people could ask for help if they got stuck on their current task.  On the few occasions that someone was stuck for a couple of scrums in a row another person would team up and they would work together to get the problem solved.  An example of this was when James was quite confused with how Yii worked and how to get the site up and running on a computer (this required setup of a server like MAMP or WAMP and setup of the database from sql files). So we met up at lunch and I spent an hour showing him the basics of the file layout and how to get it up and running, this allowed him to confidently complete the tasks assigned to him.

At the start of our project we were quite confused as to who our client was because when we asked Elise she said it was Adon, so we organised and had a meeting with him and the only user story he gave us was to create an api(I didn't know what that was at that time) for the software we had not yet began building.  So we went back to Elise and confirmed that she would be the main client and provide us with the user stories to start the project.

Our main source of communicating what were working on, bugs we found or fixed and where we recorded our user stories was a server Jordan runs and hosts which proved to be a really good way to keep up to date with who was doing what and if we were on track in each sprint and overall from start to finish of the time spent doing the project.

### Reflection
Looking back over the semester I believe that the choice to go with discord was not the best choice, I found that when someone sent a message I wouldn't always recieve a notification on my phone and I am hardly logged in on my PC.  When I sent a message I found that there usually wasn't a quick response and I had to wait before contact was intiated.  We also never used the voice channel which we orginally planed to host conference calls on, in my opinion I believe that we should have used either slack or made use of the group chat function in facebook messenger.

I think that our efforts on scrums wasn't as good as it should have been because as a group no one really pushed for these to happen and they usually only took place in class.  This meant that if someone got stuck they had to wait a few days before they could get any help to overcome the problem they were stuck on.

At the beginning I was quite confused by Jordans software which allows us to report issues and bugs, record user stories and keep track of whats happening (what build we are on, who's assigned what etc.).  Because I couldn't navigate the site easily I spent the first half of the project trying to avoid it, meaning if I found a bug instead of opening a ticket working on it and then closing it, leaving a trail of data for me to show what I have accomplished over the course of the project, I would just fix it and not tell anyone I even found it.  I feel that this is where I really fell short with my communication, however by about 4 weeks in I began to use the software more and more and learned how easy it waws to create tickets, see what needed to be done and assign and close them.  At the end of the project Jordan showed us all the graphing tools which showed exactly how much people had done (which they had recorded) and it really boosted everyones morality seeing the amount of progress we had made.


### Evidence of Learning

## Leadership
### Thoughts
When we got put into a group we established roles based on personality and skills, Jordan took charge and became the leader focusing on the backend and database side of the software, I was then assigned to look into learning the Yii framework and see if it would work to build our software around.  I built a basic template site powered by the Yii framework and we decided to go with that for our software, over the first few weeks I took charge over how the site was built and in what direction we would take it to produce the product that the client was after, this was because I was the only one who had learned the layout of the site files and how Yii was written and worked.  I gave everyone a brief outline of what Yii had to offer and demonstrated how to set it up and run it on the polytech and their own pc's, I taught Jordan how to access the database and after he had created the sql file for it I ended up taking charge of the front end.  I spent quite a wee bit of time with James as he hadn't learnt php before so he needed a little extra work to understand Yii and how it worked, we came in during our free time and work on basics like connecting to the database and running the site as well as helping him with a couple of the user stories he was working on.  

### Reflection
Looking back over the course of this project I believe I could have put myself forward and led my team a bit more, I took a pivotal role in getting the project setup and started but once we were underway I stepped back and focused on the user stories that I was assigned or assigned myself
