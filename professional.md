# Professional Proficiency

## Communication
### Thoughts
As a group we decided to go with discord for our main source of communication, this included 3 text channels, 1 for general communication, 1 for important links and 1 for files and images, and we had a voice channel for conference calls.  For recording user stories, tracking bugs and keeping track of who was doing what we used Jordans own bugtracking site made on aperion-industries server.  Even though this was quite complicated at first and was only really used by Jordan in the first couple of weeks everyone finally came to grips with the layout and functionality it became a really useful and helpful tool.

We would meet up and have scrums at least twice a week in class and some weeks we had a third scrum outside of class.  This satisfied two agile principles because we would convey information to each other face to face and at about half of these meetings we would reflect on how to become more effective, for example we moved Ryan from working on the database to working frontend because there wasn't enough work for two people on the database but there was too a lot of work needed done on the front end part of the software. This would include everyone showing what they had accomplished since the last scrum and people could ask for help if they got stuck on their current task.  On the few occasions that someone was stuck for a couple of scrums in a row another person would team up and they would work together to get the problem solved.  An example of this was when James was quite confused with how Yii worked and how to get the site up and running on a computer (this required setup of a server like MAMP or WAMP and setup of the database from sql files). So we met up at lunch and I spent an hour showing him the basics of the file layout and how to get it up and running, this allowed him to confidently complete the tasks assigned to him.

At the start of our project we were quite confused as to who our client was because when we asked Elise she said it was Adon, so we organised and had a meeting with him and the only user story he gave us was to create an api(I didn't know what that was at that time) for the software we had not yet began building.  So we went back to Elise and confirmed that she would be the main client and provide us with the user stories to start the project.

Our main source of communicating what were working on, bugs we found or fixed and where we recorded our user stories was a server Jordan runs and hosts which proved to be a really good way to keep up to date with who was doing what and if we were on track in each sprint and overall from start to finish of the time spent doing the project.

### Reflection
Looking back over the semester I believe that the choice to go with discord was not the best choice, I found that when someone sent a message I wouldn't always recieve a notification on my phone and I am hardly logged in on my PC.  When I sent a message I found that there usually wasn't a quick response and I had to wait before contact was intiated.  We also never used the voice channel which we orginally planed to host conference calls on, in my opinion I believe that we should have used either slack or made use of the group chat function in facebook messenger.

I think that our efforts on scrums wasn't as good as it should have been because as a group no one really pushed for these to happen and they usually only took place in class.  This meant that if someone got stuck they had to wait a few days before they could get any help to overcome the problem they were stuck on.  There was also no promise that everyone would show up to class, although this didn't happen too much sometimes it could be quite inconvenient and lead to tension in the group.

At the beginning I was quite confused by Jordans software which allows us to report issues and bugs, record user stories and keep track of whats happening (what build we are on, who's assigned what etc.).  Because I couldn't navigate the site easily I spent the first half of the project trying to avoid it, meaning if I found a bug instead of opening a ticket working on it and then closing it, leaving a trail of data for me to show what I have accomplished over the course of the project, I would just fix it and not tell anyone I even found it.  I feel that this is where I really fell short with my communication, however by about 4 weeks in I began to use the software more and more and learned how easy it waws to create tickets, see what needed to be done and assign and close them.  At the end of the project Jordan showed us all the graphing tools which showed exactly how much people had done (which they had recorded) and it really boosted everyones morality seeing the amount of progress we had made.


### Evidence of Learning

## Leadership
### Thoughts
When we got put into a group we established roles based on personality and skills, Jordan took charge and became the leader focusing on the backend and database side of the software, I was then assigned to look into learning the Yii framework and see if it would work to build our software around.  I built a basic template site powered by the Yii framework and we decided to go with that for our software, over the first few weeks I took charge over how the site was built and in what direction we would take it to produce the product that the client was after, this was because I was the only one who had learned the layout of the site files and how Yii was written and worked.  

I gave everyone a brief outline of what Yii had to offer and demonstrated how to set it up and run it on the polytech and their own pc's, I taught Jordan how to access the database and after he had created the sql file for it I ended up taking charge of the front end.  I spent quite a wee bit of time with James as he hadn't learnt php before so he needed a little extra work to understand Yii and how it worked, we came in during our free time and worked on basics like connecting to the database and running the site I then helped him get started with a couple of the user stories he was working on.  

I organised a meeting with Adon at the very beginning of the project which we all attended to see if he had any user stories that he wanted added to the project as there was potential of it becoming a 3rd year project, the only thing he wanted was an api.  Over the last few weeks of the project I started work on this and starting by learning api's in yii and creating a basic one which accessed everything in the database and returned it in json format.  I then took had another meeting with Adon by myself where I showed him what I had so far and asked him in what direction he wanted it to go, he showed me what he wanted and gave me a couple more user stories.  I then conveyed this new information to the rest of the group, I also went and talked to the learning analytics group as they also wanted read access to our database, however because it took so long to get a working api it was a bit late and they already had their own database that had a different layout.

### Reflection
Looking back over the course of this project I believe I could have put myself forward and led my team a bit more, I took a pivotal role in getting the project setup and started but once we were underway I stepped back and focused on the user stories that I was assigned or assigned myself.  However I did quite a wee bit of micro leadership, helping to lead a person in the right direction if they got stuck or needed something else to work on.

I believe Jordan did a really good job of holding the team together and giving people things to work on and keep everyone busy, he kept track of what everyone had done and let people know if they were falling behind in the amount they had contributed and gave them extra jobs to achieve to keep up.  

A couple of times throughout the semester mainly at the start not much work was getting done, a good leader would have motivated everyone and given everyone jobs to work on but I ended up just going home and doing the work myself this was probably not the best approach to make and if I was to go back and redo my decisions I would make different choices to help my group and be a better leader for them.

### Evidence of Learning

## Team Work
### Thoughts
Going into this project as a team we took a wee while to begin working together, not much work got done in the starting weeks, no one really knew what they were doing and it wasn't until I had created a starting site that people actually started contributing.  However once people had started learning the new framework and roles in the group had been established the project started coming along nicely.  We would meet up a couple of times a week and get progress reports and talk about what we were planning on working on next, sometimes somebody wouldn't be able to do or continue with the user story because someone else needed to do there job first, for example I couldn't display semesters until Jordan added a new attribute to the semester table in the database, but I talked to him about this and it was done within the day and I could continue with my job.

If someone was stuck and felt the need to ask for help, help was always provided which I felt was a really good aspect of the group, everyone was always willing to help and if it wasn't there strong point they would recommend someone else in the group to go and talk to about the problem.  An example of this was when James was working on getting logins working for the site he got stuck for about a week so I offered to have a look and after about 30 minutes of working together to find the problem we found that he had one bug which once fixed the login function worked perfectly.

We worked well together by working on seperate elements of the software this meant that a lot more work was getting done and there was no conflicts of code choice.  We collaborated all our work on gitlab, because we were only touching the files that we needed to work on, which we organised not to conflict, this meant that we rarely had merge errors and the only one I had to deal with was because I pulled work done at polytech on my unpushed work at home.  Using gitlab as our version control was great because we always had access to the latest version and could pull it down onto any computer.  

### Reflection

Looking back over this semester I believe that we failed to completely fulfill the agile principle *"Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project"* because we all tended to work on our own part of the software there was not much areas where multiple people worked together to get a single aspect of the software done.  This only really happened if someone got stuck but I think if we spent more time looking at each others code we could see subtle changes that could make the code more clean and easier to work and expand on.  We should of had a second person always double checking every piece of code to provide technical excellence and good design.

Although we didn't fully complete these agile principles I still feel like our group made a very good effort in supporting each other and allowing people comfort in asking for help, if we were more angry at failure to complete jobs this might have led to unhappy people producing ugly code to make simple things work which just needed a fresh eye to have a look over the code.

## Time Management
### Thoughts

I feel like for the most of this semester I managed my time quite well, I finished all the sprints I was assigned on time and kept a strong pace consistantly
